Snapshots: An Introduction to Tourism is a comprehensive and accessible introduction to the tourism industry that covers both the theoretical and practical aspects of this dynamic and diverse sector. It is suitable for students who are taking introductory courses in tourism or who want to gain a general overview of this fascinating field. It is also a valuable resource for instructors who are looking for a textbook that provides a balanced and up-to-date coverage of tourism.
  
The book also provides some statistics and facts about the tourism industry and its contribution to the global economy and society. According to the World Tourism Organization (UNWTO), the number of international tourist arrivals worldwide reached 917 million in 2021, a decrease of 73.9 percent compared to 2019 due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic[^1^]. However, the UNWTO expects a gradual recovery of international tourism in 2022 and beyond, depending on the evolution of the pandemic and the progress of vaccination campaigns. The global tourism industry also generated 5.81 trillion U.S. dollars in total contribution to GDP in 2021, accounting for 6.8 percent of the global GDP[^2^]. Moreover, the tourism industry supported 272 million jobs worldwide in 2021, equivalent to 8.8 percent of total employment[^2^]. These figures show the importance and resilience of tourism as a key driver of economic growth and social development.
